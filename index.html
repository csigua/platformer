    <h1>INFO FOR GRADERS:</h1>
    <p>Addressing the extra credit, here are the things I did:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Complex Camera (1 point)</b>: The camera has a deadzone that follows the player and it adapts to the player's movements, as stated in the assignment spec.</li>
        <li><b>Double Jumping (1 point)</b>: Later in the level, a double jump is unlocked that allows the player to go to the end.</li>
        <li><b>Juicy Juice (0.5-1 point? not sure):</b> Implemented SFX (sound) for nearly everything, animated coins and VFX for running, jumping, landing, and collecting coins/the key. The screen also shakes when you die. I don't know if this counts, but I also implemented splash text for getting a double jump, and a small shake for when Bit lands on the ground. When Bit acquires the double jump power up, his sprite changes to reflect that he can now, in fact, jump twice.</li>
        <li><b>Ways for Player to Die (1 point):</b> Added death by spikes and pits.</li>
        <li><b>Puzzles (1 point):</b> A key is needed to open the door at the end of the level. There are also interactable doorways, accessible by pressing "C" on them, and they take you to a different location.</li>
        <li><b>Power-ups (0.5 points):</b> A chest is given to the player with the double jump ability in it. This is probably a power up!</li>
        <li><b>Interactive Items (2 points):</b> Try the springs that bounce you up! Also, the doors mentioned above, and the chest should qualify as interactable items. The door at the end also requires you to use the key.</li>
        <li><b>Animated Level Elements (1 point):</b> The fans in the level are animated, as well as the coins. Bit also has animations on him.</li>
        <li><b>Things I can't categorize but extras I added:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Bit has running jumping, and idle animations for both of his variants.</li>
                <li>There is actually dialogue in the game if you play far enough. He gives various tooltips and interacts whenever certain conditions are met (try dying 5 times, or getting 10 coins)</li>
                <li>On-screen info for coins collected, number of deaths, and time spent playing</li>
                <li>The win screen will also show you this information.</li>
                <li>It is possible to win the game without dying.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
